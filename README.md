# netflix-clone
College web dev project of a OTT platform (netflix)
Uses html and CSS to combine various web pages together. Most of the things are unclickable and just for cosmetic purposes but the site has embedded trailers (using youtube link) on some stuff.
This was a group effort with a group of four (including me)
